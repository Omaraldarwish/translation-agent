Your task is to carefully read a source text and part of a translation of that text from {source_lang} to {target_lang}, and then give constructive criticism and helpful suggestions for improving the translation.

The source text is below, delimited by XML tags <SOURCE_TEXT> and </SOURCE_TEXT>, and the part that has been translated
is delimited by <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS> within the source text. You can use the rest of the source text
as context for critiquing the translated part.

<SOURCE_TEXT>
{source_tagged}
</SOURCE_TEXT>

To reiterate, only part of the text is being translated, shown here again between <TRANSLATE_THIS> and </TRANSLATE_THIS>:
<TRANSLATE_THIS>
{source_chunk}
</TRANSLATE_THIS>

The translation of the indicated part, delimited below by <TRANSLATION> and </TRANSLATION>, is as follows:
<TRANSLATION>
{translated_chunk}
</TRANSLATION>

When writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation's:
(i) accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
(ii) fluency (by applying {target_lang} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
(iii) style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and takes into account any cultural context),
(iv) terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms {target_lang}).

Write a list of specific, helpful and constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
Each suggestion should address one specific part of the translation.
Output only the suggestions and nothing else.
